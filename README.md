# Vulnerable-Bank-website
This is a vulnerable bank website I have developed as part of my capstone project to demonstrate OWASP vulnerabilities.


Follow these instructions for running the code successfully -
1. install XAMPP application
2. copy the code to the htdocs folder in the xampp folder
3. start the xampp control panel, open the admin portal for the PHP application, and change the password to root (default password is set to none) here you can change the password to anything but update the db_connect php as well with a password of what you have changed to in the phpmyadmin portal.
4. create a database and update the name like we have updated the password.
5. Now the application will run successfully.
