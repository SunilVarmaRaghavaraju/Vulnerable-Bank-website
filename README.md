# Vulnerable-Bank-website
This is a vulnerable bank website I have developed as part of my capstone project to demonstrate OWASP vulnerabilities.

## Brief on the Vulnerable Bank website
This vulnerable bank website is named Cbank, and this project's main purpose was to demonstrate OWASP web vulnerabilities as part of my capstone. The website has two security modes where I wanted to demonstrate vulnerabilities in low-security mode and update or remediate the website as part of the high-security or high-level mode for demonstration.


Follow these instructions for running the code successfully in a local environment-
1. install XAMPP application
2. copy the code to the htdocs folder in the xampp folder
3. start the xampp control panel, open the admin portal for the PHP application, and change the password to root (default password is set to none) here you can change the password to anything but update the "db_connect.php" as well with a password of what you have changed to in the phpmyadmin portal.
4. create a database, check the "SQL query.txt" file, and update the name like we have updated the password.
5. Now the application will run successfully.
